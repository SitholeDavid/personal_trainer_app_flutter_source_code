# Personal Trainer App

This is a flutter app for personal trainers. It allows them to offer their clients the ability to book training sessions online. It also offers clients the ability to purchase training plans from the trainer. The trainer receives live updates on new and cancelled bookings as well as the number of sessions left on each day. The trainer no longer has to keep up with the burden of keeping track of the number of sessions each client has completed.

This app is linked to the personal trainer client app for the trainer's customers.

The app utilizes Firebase FCM messaging, Firebase cloud storage, Firebase firestore and also Firebase Auth.

For state management the stacked and stacked_services packages were used. 

Get_It was used for dependency injection.

Abstraction was used for the service classes to make mock unit testing easier.
